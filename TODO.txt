In order: 

TODO: Show info about github account after OAUTH-verification
TODO: Show authenticated users portfolios
TODO: Create designated error pages for bad connections to the server and general errors. Take a look at the loading and error-modules for Nuxt
TODO: Code Cleanup and refactoring (Fix null values coming from the DB is one)
TODO: Focus on styling. Create the home page
TODO: Sign-in compatibility


Fluffy ideas: 

1. Show latest commit in code-form in the portfolio
2. Percentage of frontend and backend code in the repo
3. Drag and Drop Portfolio creator

In order: 

TODO: Style the Create Profile Page. Use Vuex Store to handle the state of the profileinfo. Set up an ENUM for the separate component states, then store an array with the component names that references the states. 
TODO: Make a distinct footer for the Next and Previous Step buttons
TODO: Use the state to style the StateNavigator
TODO: Create loading animations for github oauth and loading in general
TODO: Create designated error pages for bad connections to the server and general errors. Take a look at the loading and error-modules for Nuxt
TODO: Add more data to the portfolio page, such as amount of codelines per framework and technology
TODO: Delete unnecessary endpoints in the API
TODO: Sign-in compatibility
TODO: Make sure the navbar has the correct headers and functionality based on there being a user that is "signed in"
TODO: Add all animations to the assets folder
TODO: Make sure the user never has to navigate to null values. I.E IF the user has a null-value in their profile, don't even show any interactivity with that component. 


Fluffy ideas: 

1. Show latest commit in code-form in the portfolio
2. Percentage of frontend and backend code in the repo
3. Drag and Drop Portfolio creator

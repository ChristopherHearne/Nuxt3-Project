In order: 

TODO: Focus on styling. Make sure footer and navbar is fixed. Create the home page (loading-animations etc.)
TODO: Add more data to the portfolio page, such as amount of codelines per framework and technology
TODO: Create designated error pages for bad connections to the server and general errors. Take a look at the loading and error-modules for Nuxt
TODO: Sign-in compatibility


Fluffy ideas: 

1. Show latest commit in code-form in the portfolio
2. Percentage of frontend and backend code in the repo
3. Drag and Drop Portfolio creator
